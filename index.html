        <h2> Bio </h2>
        <p> Disturbed is an American Heavy Metal Band originally 
            formed in Chicago in 1994. Originally the band was 
            named "Brawl" which changed in 1996 after David Draiman 
            joined.  </p>

        <p>David Draiman's audition story is quite amusing. After
            auditioning for 20 other bands in the same month, he auditioned
            for "Brawl" and became an instant hit with his unique voice,
            great talent and a desire for creating original content.
            The other band members tried to hide their enthusiasm but truth was, 
            they were ecsatic with him.
